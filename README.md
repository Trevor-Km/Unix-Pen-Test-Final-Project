# Penetration-Test-Project
## Project Description
This project involves a detailed penetration testing exercise using two well-known security-focused operating systems: Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS. Our goal is to explore, identify, and exploit vulnerabilities within a controlled environment, simulating real-world cyber-attack scenarios. Throughout this repository, we will document each step of the process, including the tools used, methods applied, and challenges encountered. Our aim is to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both operating systems in the context of penetration testing.
